//! **The RISC-V (rv64) architecture layer.** The second implementation of the `arch/` contract
//! (milestone 20, notes/riscv-port.md), the one that proves rule #1: the rest of the kernel calls
//! everything here through `crate::arch`, exactly the names it calls on aarch64.
//!
//! This is a scaffold. The pieces that are pure and portable-in-spirit (the per-CPU register, the
//! halt/idle/barrier primitives, the initial thread contexts) are real. The pieces that are the
//! work of later steps (MMU/Sv39, traps, the timer, SMP bring-up, the test-exit) are loud
//! `unimplemented!()` stubs, each naming the step that fills it, so nobody mistakes a stub for a
//! working port. What is proved *today* is that the boundary is complete: a second architecture
//! compiles and links against the whole kernel with no change above `arch/`.

/// target hart has drained it, so by the time `ecall` returns no target holds an entry wearing this
